    <h2>Nick woodman made a small gopro session.That was so small that you can pit it in you poket and had 4k 30frames per second. But you could not replace the battery.Becauses it was builded in the camera, so it had a horable life time.
      It was not designed to be the “cheap camera” and was initially positioned at a $399 price point near the high-end of its lineup. The company ultimately failed to really differentiate the Session form factor and despite an ambitious introduction it just kind of ended up becoming the company’s low-end product that didn’t work with any of the existing GoPro accessories that were being sold.The writing was on the wall when the company neglected to refresh the hardware at its Hero6 event last year, but the Hero5 Session kept chugging along as the entry-level GoPro until the company showed off a new $199 Hero camera in March.
