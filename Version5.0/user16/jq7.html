        <h1>My School Year</h1>
        <p> Its been great but there have been off days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quarter 1 was great figuring out where my classes are on the first day.
            First quarter flew by slow.
            All my classes were cool manufacturing and construction was cool because i got to build a table. <span class="co">Quarter 1</span>
             energy, food, and the outdoors was a cool experience class. Also Math and Modern us history were easy to me.
            I understood the content well and did well on the exams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quarter 1 was also great, found out directions and got to my class without getting loss.
            Second quarter flew by fast cause some of the week we were online.
            All my classes were cool ceramics was cool because i got to use clay and make clay pots. <span class="co">Quarter 2</span>
             Sports and entertainment marketing i got to learn a little about marketing and what goes into it. Also Math and Modern us history were easy to me and i still had these classes.
            I understood the content in every class i had and had good grades
        
        </p>
        <p>
            Quarter 3 was great, most of my classes were easy.
            Third quarter flew by fast.
            All my classes were cool Advanced sports performance was cool because i got to weight lift and have free time to play basketball. <span class="co">Quarter 3</span>
             healthy lifestles was a easy class but require alot of time on homework but there was so much of it. 
            Instead of Math and Modern US History, this quarter i switched to chemistry and english.
        </p>
        <p>
             Quarter 4 is still going and its flying by quick.
            Gonna give my all in the next coming weeks.
            Can't wait for summer.
        </p>
