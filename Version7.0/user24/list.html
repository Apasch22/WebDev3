<h1>Here are some of the most hardest positions to play in the NFL</h1>

<h3>1) The Cornerback is arguably the hardest position to play in football because they must be able to 
    react in a fast amount of time having to be in the game mentally and physically. Being a great cornerback requires
    good speed, good reaction time, fast agility and always staying mentally focused. It makes it  a lot harder to guard
    Wide Receivers that have amazing route running and speed.

    Down below is a video that shows how hard it is to play the cornerback position.</h3>

    <h3>2) Anybody who plays in the O-line can be a very hard and skilled position because of what it requires and what
      skill it takes to be good at this position, you must be able to react in less than a second whenever the offensive play starts 
      and having to take on men who are 6'5 300+ pounds running after you and trying to take you donw onto the ground.
