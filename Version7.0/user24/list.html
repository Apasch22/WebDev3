<h1>Here are some of the most hardest positions to play in the NFL</h1>

<h3>1) The Cornerback is arguably the hardest position to play in football because they must be able to 
    react in a fast amount of time having to be in the game mentally and physically. Being a great cornerback requires
    good speed, good reaction time, fast agility and always staying mentally focused. It makes it  a lot harder to guard
    Wide Receivers that have amazing route running and speed.
</h3>

<h3>Down below is a video that shows how hard it is to play the cornerback position.</h3>

<h3>2) Any position in the O-Line is the second hardest position because of the reaction time that is needed and
  how much strength is required and used for every offensive play having big grown men that are 6'5 300+ pounds
running at you full speed trying to tackle you onto the ground to stop the play as soon as they can, this position
requires a lot of strength and toughness to be able to put up with the opponents defensive line. </h3>

<h3>3) The Quarterback is the third hardest position because of how important their role is and because they 
  are the leader of their team, they must be able to remember every offensive play and know when to give up the ball when needed,
  they are also under a lot of pressure because of the defensive linemen that run after them to take the QB down and 
  how much expectation is given towards them</h3>
